You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use markdown links (not inline code) for clickable files.\n  * Each file reference should have a stand-alone path; use inline code for non-clickable paths (for example, directories).\n  * For clickable/openable file references, the path target must be an absolute filesystem path. Labels may be short (for example, `[app.ts](/abs/path/app.ts)`).\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"dbe94406b1adba5b645cf16d72000704b117cb3f","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/agurod42/torre-ca.git"}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"effort":"xhigh","summary":"auto","user_instructions":"# AGENTS.md — Engineering Decisions & Constraints\n\n> **For LLMs working on this codebase:** This file is the authoritative record of every significant engineering decision made during the build of Torre Swipe. If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

No account needed.\n\nSee [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) for the full product and technical specification.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n  User[Job Seeker]\n  Web[apps/web<br/>Next.js frontend<br/>:3000]\n  Api[apps/api<br/>Next.js BFF<br/>:3001]\n  Torre[(search.torre.co)]\n  Local[(Browser localStorage)]\n  Shared[@torre-swipe/types<br/>@torre-swipe/torre-client]\n\n  User -->|Swipe / keyboard actions| Web\n  Web -->|/api/opportunities| Api\n  Api -->|Torre search request<br/>status: open| Torre\n  Torre -->|Opportunities JSON| Api\n  Api -->|Filtered response + CORS| Web\n  Web -->|Persist seen/liked/passed ids| Local\n  Web -. uses .-> Shared\n  Api -. uses .-> Shared\n```\n\n**Why two apps?** The Torre search API does not allow cross-origin browser requests. `apps/api` acts as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF): it receives requests from `apps/web`, proxies them server-side to Torre, and returns the results — keeping the upstream API call off the browser entirely.\n\n**Shared packages** (`@torre-swipe/types`, `@torre-swipe/torre-client`) are consumed via TypeScript path aliases — no build step required for local development.\n\n---\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n| Layer | Technology | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Monorepo | Turborepo ^2 | Task graph, incremental builds |\n| Package manager | pnpm ^9 | Workspace support |\n| Language | TypeScript ^5.4 | Strict mode throughout |\n| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router) | Client-side rendered swipe UI |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS ^3.4 | Dark theme, design tokens from `references/ui/` |\n| Animations | Framer Motion ^11 | Spring physics, drag gesture |\n| State | Zustand ^4 | Queue, undo, celebration, animation flags |\n| BFF | Next.js API Routes | Proxies Torre API, adds CORS headers |\n| HTTP | Native `fetch` | Node 18+ and browser built-in |\n| Testing | Vitest + React Testing Library | Unit + component tests |\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js** ≥ 20\n- **pnpm** ≥ 9 (`npm install -g pnpm` or via `corepack enable`)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started (without Docker)\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install all workspace dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# 2. Set up environment files\ncp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env.local\ncp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local\n\n# 3. Start both apps concurrently (Turborepo orchestrates them)\npnpm dev\n```\n\n- Web app: http://localhost:3000\n- BFF API: http://localhost:3001\n- Health check: http://localhost:3001/api/health\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started (with Docker)\n\nThe `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts and `next dev` for hot reload.\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up\n```\n\n- Web app: http://localhost:3000\n- BFF API: http://localhost:3001\n\n> **Note:** First startup is slow because `pnpm install` runs inside the containers. Subsequent starts use cached Docker volumes for `node_modules`.\n\n---\n\n## Running Tests\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests across all apps\npnpm test\n\n# Run tests for a specific app\npnpm --filter api test\npnpm --filter web test\n\n# Run with coverage\npnpm --filter api test:coverage\npnpm --filter web test:coverage\n```\n\n**Coverage targets:**\n- `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%\n- `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%\n\n---\n\n## Deployment (Dokploy)\n\nEach app is deployed independently. In Dokploy, create two services:\n\n| Service | Dockerfile | Build context |\n|---|---|---|\n| API | `apps/api/Dockerfile` | Monorepo root |\n| Web | `apps/web/Dockerfile` | Monorepo root |\n\nThe build context must be the **monorepo root** so Turborepo can prune the dependency graph correctly.\n\n**Required environment variables per service:**\n\n| Variable | Service | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` | api | `https://search.torre.co` |\n| `DEBUG_LOGS` | api | `false` |\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | web (build arg) | `https://api.yourapp.com` |\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS` | web | `false` |\n\n> `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are baked into the Next.js bundle at **build time**. Set them as Docker build arguments in Dokploy, not just as runtime environment variables.\n\n---\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n| Variable | App | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | web | `http://localhost:3001` | URL of the BFF API |\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS` | web | `false` | Enable browser console debug logs |\n| `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` | api | `https://search.torre.co` | Torre upstream API base URL |\n| `DEBUG_LOGS` | api | `false` | Enable server-side debug logs |\n\n---\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ntorre-ca/\n├── AGENTS.md                   ← Engineering decisions for LLMs (keep current!)\n├── README.md                   ← This file\n├── docker-compose.yml          ← Local dev only\n├── package.json                ← Root workspace scripts\n├── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n├── turbo.json\n├── tsconfig.base.json\n│\n├── docs/\n│   ├── SPEC.md                 ← Product + technical specification\n│   └── UI_SPEC.md              ← UI design notes\n│\n├── references/\n│   └── ui/\n│       ├── home-screen.html    ← Visual design source of truth (home)\n│       └── empty-screen.html   ← Visual design source of truth (empty state)\n│\n├── packages/\n│   ├── types/                  ← @torre-swipe/types\n│   │   └── src/\n│   │       ├── opportunity.ts  ← All domain types\n│   │       └── storage.ts      ← StorageStrategy interface\n│   └── torre-client/           ← @torre-swipe/torre-client\n│       └── src/\n│           ├── client.ts       ← TorreClient + TorreApiError\n│           └── storage/\n│               └── LocalStorageStrategy.ts\n│\n├── apps/\n│   ├── api/                    ← BFF (port 3001)\n│   │   ├── app/api/\n│   │   │   ├── opportunities/route.ts   ← POST /api/opportunities\n│   │   │   └── health/route.ts          ← GET /api/health\n│   │   ├── lib/\n│   │   │   ├── validation.ts   ← Zod schema\n│   │   │   └── logger.ts       ← Server debug logger\n│   │   └── __tests__/\n│   │       ├── torre.test.ts\n│   │       └── route.test.ts\n│   │\n│   └── web/                    ← Frontend (port 3000)\n│       ├── app/\n│       │   ├── layout.tsx      ← Inter font, dark class\n│       │   ├── page.tsx        ← Home page + keyboard handler\n│       │   └── globals.css     ← Tailwind + custom CSS from references\n│       ├── components/\n│       │   ├── SwipeStack.tsx\n│       │   ├── JobCard.tsx\n│       │   ├── ActionBar.tsx\n│       │   ├── SkeletonCard.tsx\n│       │   ├── EmptyState.tsx\n│       │   └── CelebrationOverlay.tsx\n│       ├── hooks/\n│       │   ├── useSwipeQueue.ts\n│       │   └── useDragCard.ts\n│       ├── store/\n│       │   └── swipeStore.ts\n│       └── lib/\n│           ├── api.ts          ← BFF fetch wrapper\n│           └── logger.ts       ← Client debug logger\n```\n"}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file.

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you change any decision listed here, **update this file in the same commit**. The file must always reflect the current state of the codebase, not historical intent.\n\n---\n\n## Product Constraints\n\n- **No user authentication** — the app is fully anonymous; no login, no accounts.\n- **No server-side match history** — liked/passed state lives only in `localStorage` on the client.\n- **No employer-facing features** — read-only job browsing only.\n- **Single-screen UI** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` is the only page. No routing.\n- **External applications only** — LIKE and SUPER LIKE open `externalApplicationUrl` in a new tab; no in-app application flow.\n- **1-level undo only** — only the most recent swipe can be undone.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Design Decisions\n\n- **Dark mode only** — no light mode variant exists or is planned.\n- **Single source of truth for all UI** — `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` are the pixel-level design spec. All colors, CSS classes, SVG paths, layout structure, and design tokens must match those files exactly.\n- **Tailwind color palette** (from `home-screen.html`):\n  - `primary: \"#CCDC39\"` — Torre lime-green accent\n  - `bg-midnight: \"#0B0E14\"` — page background\n  - `card-dark: \"#1C1F26\"` — card background\n  - `card-dark-lighter: \"#282C35\"` — button/input backgrounds\n  - `neon-cyan: \"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta: \"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber: \"#FDE68A\"` — skill chip colors\n- **Custom CSS classes** (defined verbatim in `apps/web/app/globals.css`): `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer`, `.animate-star-burst`.\n- **Like button** uses Torre primary color (`#CCDC39`), not green — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Super like button** uses the Torre logo SVG path (`M12 2L4.5 20.29l.71.71L12 18l6.79 3 .71-.71L12 2z`), not a star emoji — overrides spec §3.5.\n- **Header app icon** uses a custom portrait image (`/header-icon.jpg`) instead of the Torre arrow SVG in the top-left badge — overrides `home-screen.html`.\n- **Card layout**: banner image area (h-44) with gradient overlay + company logo at bottom-left, followed by content area — matches `home-screen.html`'s card structure.\n- **Card border-radius**: `rounded-[32px]` for cards, `rounded-[48px]` reserved for phone frame (not used in production app).\n- **Font**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700), loaded via `next/font/google`.\n- **Icons**: Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via CDN in `page.tsx`.\n- **App shell in production**: `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` — the phone frame chrome in the HTML references (rounded border, status bar) is for design preview only and is NOT rendered in the real app.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm** — task graph: `build` depends on `^build`; `dev` is persistent and uncached; `test` depends on `^build`.\n- **Two separate Next.js apps**:\n  - `apps/api` — BFF only (port 3001); no frontend pages; no SSR for client data.\n  - `apps/web` — frontend only (port 3000); all UI lives here.\n- **BFF is mandatory** — all calls to `https://search.torre.co` go through `apps/api`. Direct calls from the browser are prohibited (CORS + keeping the upstream API server-side).\n- **Shared packages** use the `@torre-swipe/` scope:\n  - `@torre-swipe/types` — TypeScript types only, no runtime code.\n  - `@torre-swipe/torre-client` — `TorreClient`, `TorreApiError`, `LocalStorageStrategy`.\n- **No build step for shared packages** — workspace packages are consumed via TypeScript path aliases (`tsconfig.json` `paths`). The `main` field points directly to `src/index.ts`.\n- **`output: \"standalone\"` only in production** — both `next.config.mjs` files gate the standalone output on `NODE_ENV === \"production\"` so that `docker-compose` hot-reload still works.\n\n---\n\n## State Management Decisions\n\n- **Zustand** for all client state — `apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts`.\n- **`StorageStrategy` interface** (`packages/types/src/storage.ts`) abstracts persistence — the store holds a reference and calls it; callers inject the implementation at bootstrap.\n- **`LocalStorageStrategy`** is the only provided implementation — capped at 500 entries to avoid quota issues; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is exceeded.\n- **Seen IDs are persisted on every swipe** (fire-and-forget) under the key `torre_seen_ids`.\n- **The queue is never persisted** — on page reload, cards are re-fetched from the BFF.\n- **Undo stack depth: 1** — `undoCard` holds at most one card. After undo, `undoCard` is cleared.\n- **Queue constants**:\n  - `INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE = 20`\n  - `REFILL_SIZE = 10`\n  - `REFILL_THRESHOLD = 5` (trigger refill when queue drops below this)\n  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50`\n\n---\n\n## Testing Decisions\n\n- **Test runner: Vitest** in both `apps/api` and `apps/web`.\n- **Component testing: React Testing Library** (behavior-focused, no snapshot tests).\n- **Coverage provider: v8** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`).\n- **Coverage targets**:\n  - `apps/api`: statements ≥ 98%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 98%, lines ≥ 98%.\n  - `apps/web`: statements ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.\n- **E2E tests: deferred** — Playwright is listed as a future-work dependency; no E2E tests exist in v1.\n- **Mocking strategy (api)**: `vi.stubGlobal(\"fetch\", vi.fn())` — the global `fetch` is mocked so no real HTTP calls are made.\n- **Mocking strategy (web components)**: `framer-motion` and `next/image` are mocked in component tests to avoid animation/SSR complexity.\n- **CI test automation**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pnpm test` on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.\n\n---\n\n## Logging Decisions\n\n- **Environment variable gates**:\n  - `apps/api`: `DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n  - `apps/web`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS=true` enables logging.\n- **Logger format**: `[api:info]` / `[web:info]` prefixes, wrapping `console.log/warn/error`.\n- **Logging is disabled by default** — `.env.example` files set both flags to `false`.\n- **In production, logging MUST remain disabled** — never set `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in a production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Decisions\n\n- **Each app has its own `Dockerfile`** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`) using a 4-stage build: `base → pruner → installer → builder → runner`.\n- **Turborepo `turbo prune --scope=<app> --docker`** is used to produce a minimal file set for each image.\n- **`docker-compose.yml`** is for **local development only** — it uses bind mounts + hot reload (not the production Dockerfiles).\n- **Dokploy deployment**: point each service at its respective `Dockerfile`; the build context must be the monorepo root so that `turbo prune` can see all packages.\n- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** must be provided as a Docker build arg for `apps/web` in production, because Next.js bakes public env vars at build time.\n- **Named Docker volumes** for `node_modules` in `docker-compose.yml` — prevents macOS ↔ Linux binary incompatibility when bind-mounting the repo.\n\n---\n\n## API Integration Decisions\n\n- **Torre API base URL**: `https://search.torre.co` (server-side only, via `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var in `apps/api`).\n- **Always include `status: open`** in the Torre search request body.\n- **Default query params**: `lang=en`, `contextFeature=job_feed`, `currency=USD`, `periodicity=yearly`.\n- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all responses from `apps/api` (including error responses). Restrict to the web origin in a hardened production deployment.\n- **BFF does NOT filter by `seenIds`** — deduplication is the frontend's responsibility.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- app-icon: Generate app icons for your React Native Expo app with iOS 26 support (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/app-icon/SKILL.md)\n- better-icons: Use when working with icons in any project. Provides CLI for searching 200+ icon libraries (Iconify) and retrieving SVGs. Commands: `better-icons search <query>` to find icons, `better-icons get <id>` to get SVG. Also available as MCP server for AI agents. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/better-icons/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- huashu-md-to-pdf: 将 Markdown 文档转换为专业的 PDF 白皮书，采用苹果设计风格。 支持完整的 Markdown 语法（代码块、表格、引用、列表等）。 自动生成封面、目录、页眉页脚。 使用场景：技术文档、白皮书、教程、报告等需要专业排版的 Markdown 文档。 (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/huashu-md-to-pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pdf: Use this skill whenever the user wants to do anything with PDF files. This includes reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs, combining or merging multiple PDFs into one, splitting PDFs apart, rotating pages, adding watermarks, creating new PDFs, filling PDF forms, encrypting/decrypting PDFs, extracting images, and OCR on scanned PDFs to make them searchable. If the user mentions a .pdf file or asks to produce one, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)\n- pptx: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.agents/skills/pptx/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/agurodriguez/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
