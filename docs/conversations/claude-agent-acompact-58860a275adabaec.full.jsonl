In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off.

Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user asked to understand the Torre Swipe spec (docs/SPEC.md) and build a complete implementation plan, then implement it. The app is a Tinder-style job discovery web app using Torre.ai's public API. Additional requirements added during planning:\n   - AGENTS.md file with all engineering decisions/constraints, instructing LLMs to update it when changing decisions\n   - README.md explaining product, architecture, and getting started (audience: engineers)\n   - Debug logging toggled via environment variables (`DEBUG_LOGS` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS`)\n   - Dockerfile for each app (web + api) for Dokploy deployment, plus docker-compose for local development only\n   - UI implementation must use `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` as the source of truth (not pixel-precise references in plan — just tell the LLM to read those files)\n   - Commit after each logical unit of work using Conventional Commits standard\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo (task graph: build→^build, dev persistent, test→^build)\n   - **Two Next.js apps**: `apps/api` (BFF, port 3001) and `apps/web` (frontend, port 3000)\n   - **BFF pattern**: All Torre API calls go server-side through `apps/api` to avoid CORS\n   - **Shared packages**: `@torre-swipe/types` (types only) and `@torre-swipe/torre-client` (TorreClient, TorreApiError, LocalStorageStrategy) — consumed via TS path aliases, no build step\n   - **Framer Motion**: Spring physics drag gesture (`useMotionValue`, `useTransform`, `useAnimation`), throw threshold detection (|x|>100px or y<-100px), overlay opacity driven by motion values without re-renders\n   - **Zustand store**: Queue management, seenIds dedup, 1-level undo, isAnimating/isCelebrating flags, StorageStrategy injection\n   - **StorageStrategy interface**: Abstraction for persistence — `LocalStorageStrategy` caps at 500 entries\n   - **Queue constants**: INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE=20, REFILL_SIZE=10, REFILL_THRESHOLD=5, MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=50\n   - **Visual design source of truth**: `references/ui/home-screen.html` and `references/ui/empty-screen.html` — Torre dark theme, primary #CCDC39, card-dark #1C1F26, bg-midnight #0B0E14\n   - **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library; api coverage ≥98%, web coverage ≥80%\n   - **Docker**: Multi-stage Dockerfile (pruner→installer→builder→runner using `turbo prune`), docker-compose with bind mounts + named volumes for node_modules, `output: \"standalone\"` gated on production\n   - **Debug logging**: `logger.ts` in each app, enabled only when env var is `\"true\"`\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   **Root files**:\n   - `package.json`: `{ \"name\": \"torre-swipe\", \"private\": true, \"scripts\": { \"dev\": \"turbo dev\", \"build\": \"turbo build\", \"test\": \"turbo test\" }, \"devDependencies\": { \"turbo\": \"^2.0.0\", \"typescript\": \"^5.4.0\" }, \"packageManager\": \"pnpm@9.0.0\" }`\n   - `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: `packages: [\"apps/*\", \"packages/*\"]`\n   - `turbo.json`: standard task graph\n   - `tsconfig.base.json`: strict mode, `moduleResolution: bundler`, `jsx: react-jsx`\n   - `.gitignore`: Node/Next.js/pnpm standard ignores\n   - `AGENTS.md`: Engineering decisions doc (created, not yet committed) — covers product constraints, visual design, architecture, state management, testing, logging, deployment, API integration decisions; includes instruction \"If you change any decision listed here, update this file in the same commit\"\n   - `README.md`: Product overview, architecture ASCII diagram, tech stack table, getting started (with/without Docker), running tests, Dokploy deployment guide, environment variables table, project structure tree\n\n   **packages/types/src/opportunity.ts**: All domain types from spec §5.2 — `Opportunity`, `Organization`, `Compensation`, `Skill`, `Place`, `SearchFilter`, `SearchRequest`, `SearchResponse`\n\n   **packages/types/src/storage.ts**:\n   ```ts\n   export interface StorageStrategy {\n     loadSeenIds(): Promise<Set<string>>;\n     saveSeenIds(ids: Set<string>): Promise<void>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **packages/torre-client/src/client.ts**: `TorreClient` class with `searchOpportunities(params)` — builds query string, constructs `{and: [{status:{code:\"open\"}}, ...filters]}` body, fetches Torre API, throws `TorreApiError` on non-200. `TorreApiError extends Error` with `status: number` and `body: string`.\n\n   **packages/torre-client/src/storage/LocalStorageStrategy.ts**: `KEY=\"torre_seen_ids\"`, `MAX_ENTRIES=500`, loads/saves Set<string> to localStorage with cap enforcement.\n\n   **apps/api/lib/validation.ts**: Zod schema for `OpportunitiesRequest` — size (1-20, default 10), keywords, language, fluency enum, currency, periodicity enum.\n\n   **apps/api/lib/logger.ts**:\n   ```ts\n   const enabled = process.env.DEBUG_LOGS === \"true\";\n   export const logger = { info: (...args) => { if (enabled) console.log(\"[api:info]\", ...args); }, ... };\n   ```\n\n   **apps/api/app/api/opportunities/route.ts**: POST handler — parse body, validate with Zod, call TorreClient, return JSON with CORS headers. OPTIONS handler for preflight. `CORS_HEADERS = {\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\", ...}`. Torre client instantiated from `TORRE_API_BASE_URL` env var.\n\n   **apps/api/app/api/health/route.ts**: `GET(): NextResponse.json({ ok: true })`\n\n   **apps/api/__tests__/torre.test.ts**: Stubs global fetch, tests happy path, TorreApiError on non-200, network failure, compensation.visible=false, filter types in body, query param serialization, empty results.\n\n   **apps/api/__tests__/route.test.ts**: Mocks TorreClient, tests valid POST→200, invalid body→400, Torre throws→502, CORS headers on all responses, OPTIONS→204, default size=10.\n\n   **apps/web/tailwind.config.ts**: Dark mode `class`, colors from reference HTML: `primary:\"#CCDC39\"`, `bg-midnight:\"#0B0E14\"`, `card-dark:\"#1C1F26\"`, `card-dark-lighter:\"#282C35\"`, `neon-cyan:\"#A5F3FC\"`, `neon-magenta:\"#FBCFE8\"`, `neon-amber:\"#FDE68A\"`.\n\n   **apps/web/app/globals.css**: `@tailwind` directives + all custom CSS copied verbatim from reference HTML files: `.btn-glow-red`, `.btn-glow-blue`, `.btn-glow-torre`, `.card-shadow-vibrant`, `.glow-text-primary`, `.glow-emoji`, `.btn-refresh-shadow`, `.shimmer` (gradient sweep animation), `.animate-star-burst` (CSS keyframes).\n\n   **apps/web/store/swipeStore.ts**: Zustand store — `addCards` (dedup + MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=50), `swipe` (removes top, saves undoCard, adds to seenIds, fire-and-forget saveSeenIds, sets isCelebrating on super), `undo` (prepend undoCard back, delete from seenIds), setters. `initSwipeStore(storage)` loads seenIds async.\n\n   **apps/web/hooks/useSwipeQueue.ts**: Initial fetch on mount (INITIAL_FETCH_SIZE=20) via `useRef` guard, refill when `queue.length < 5 && queue.length > 0 && !isFetching` (REFILL_SIZE=10). `preloadImages(cards, count=5)` uses `new Image()`. Returns `{ fetchMore }`.\n\n   **apps/web/hooks/useDragCard.ts**: `x`, `y` motion values; `rotate = useTransform(x, [-200,200], [-20,20])`; `likeOpacity`, `nopeOpacity`, `superOpacity` transforms; `handleDragEnd` checks `oy < -100` (super), `ox > 100` (like), `ox < -100` (pass), else spring back; `triggerSwipe(direction)` programmatic exit; `prefersReducedMotion` check.\n\n   **apps/web/lib/api.ts**: `fetchOpportunities(params)` — POST to `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/opportunities` with default `{size:10, currency:\"USD\", periodicity:\"yearly\"}`.\n\n   **apps/web/lib/logger.ts**: Same pattern as api logger but uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGS` and `[web:info]` prefix.\n\n   **apps/web/components/JobCard.tsx**: Banner (h-44, next/image, gradient overlay, company logo bottom-left), content area (title, company name, salary formatted with `formatK`, location, commitment, tagline line-clamp-3, skills up to 3 with `skillChipClass` based on `simpleHash(name) % 3`, overflow +N). Drag overlay stamps (LIKE/NOPE/SUPER) as `motion.div` with opacity from motion values. `aria-label`, `role=\"article\"`, `tabIndex={0}`.\n\n   **apps/web/components/ActionBar.tsx**: Footer structure from home-screen.html. Pass (w-14, btn-glow-red, rose-500, `close` icon), Like (w-20, bg-primary, shadow-primary/40, `favorite` FILL=1), Super (w-14, btn-glow-torre, Torre logo SVG). All disabled + opacity-40 when `isAnimating`.\n\n   **apps/web/components/SwipeStack.tsx**: BackCard decorative div (absolute.inset-x-6 from reference), top card as `motion.div` with drag props and `useDragCard` controls, JobCard dynamically imported. Shows SkeletonCard when `isFetching && queue.length===0`, EmptyState when `!isFetching && queue.length===0`.\n\n   **apps/web/components/EmptyState.tsx**: Copied from empty-screen.html — 🎉 with glow backdrop, heading, subtext, refresh button (bg-primary, btn-refresh-shadow), disabled footer buttons (opacity-40 grayscale).\n\n   **apps/web/components/CelebrationOverlay.tsx**: Fixed inset-0, bg-black/70, z-50. Auto-dismiss after 1500ms via `useEffect` timeout. Click anywhere to dismiss early. `animate-star-burst` on ⭐.\n\n   **apps/web/app/page.tsx**: `\"use client\"`. `useStorageInit()` — module-level guard, calls `initSwipeStore(new LocalStorageStrategy())` once. `Header` component with Torre logo SVG + \"Torre Swipe\" title + undo button. `useEffect` for keyboard handler (ArrowRight→like, ArrowLeft→pass, ArrowUp→super, Z→undo). Renders `<Header>`, `<SwipeStack>`, `<ActionBar>`, `{isCelebrating && <CelebrationOverlay>}`, home indicator bar. Loads Material Symbols font via `<link>`.\n\n   **Test files**:\n   - `__tests__/store/swipeStore.test.ts`: addCards dedup + MAX_QUEUE_SIZE, swipe(like/pass/super), undo restore + no-op, fire-and-forget saveSeenIds\n   - `__tests__/hooks/useSwipeQueue.test.ts`: initial fetch, skip if queue non-empty, seenIds filter, error handling\n   - `__tests__/components/JobCard.test.tsx`: all data mappings tested\n   - `__tests__/components/ActionBar.test.tsx`: buttons, disabled state, click handlers\n   - `__tests__/components/EmptyState.test.tsx`: heading, refresh, disabled footer\n   - `__tests__/components/SwipeStack.test.tsx`: skeleton/empty/card states\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **JobCard.tsx bug**: Initial version had `const compensation = {} as Opportunity[\"compensation\"]` at the bottom of the file (a leftover placeholder) and referenced `compensation.visible` in the salary row JSX from outside the component scope. Fixed by completely rewriting the component to use `job.compensation` directly throughout — `const salaryParts = salaryText.split(\" / \")` and conditionally rendering based on `job.compensation.visible`.\n   - **ExitPlanMode rejection**: First two attempts to exit plan mode with `allowedPrompts` were rejected by the user. On the third attempt (with no allowedPrompts), it succeeded after the user said \"Amazing! Go and implement it.\"\n   - **vitest.config.ts for web needs @vitejs/plugin-react**: Added `@vitejs/plugin-react: \"^4.3.0\"` to devDependencies after writing the vitest config that imports it.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Reconciling spec vs. UI references**: The SPEC.md text described different visual details (green like button, star super button, different colors) than the HTML references. Resolved by making references/ui/ the authoritative source for all visual decisions, and noting the overrides in AGENTS.md.\n   - **Phone frame chrome**: The HTML references show a phone mockup frame (rounded-[48px], status bar, border). The real app omits this chrome and uses `max-w-[400px] mx-auto h-dvh flex flex-col` instead.\n   - **No build step for packages**: Shared packages use TS path aliases so they can be consumed directly from `src/` without a compile step.\n   - **Standalone output gating**: `output: \"standalone\"` is gated on `process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\"` in both `next.config.ts` files so docker-compose hot-reload works.\n   - **Named Docker volumes**: Used for node_modules in docker-compose to prevent macOS↔Linux binary compatibility issues with bind mounts.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"understand this spec and build an implementation plan: [full SPEC.md content]\"\n   - \"let's add a few things to the implementation: - make sure to add an AGENTS.md file with all the engineering decisions we have made and the constraints we have defined; make sure LLMs reading this file, update it if they change some decision or constrain - make sure to add a README file explaining the product, the architecture, and how to get started (audience is other engineers in the team) - make sure to add debugging logs that can be turn off/on using a env var - make sure to add a Dockerfile for each app so I can deploy it using Dokploy and also add a docker compose file that I'll use exclusively to launch the local environemtn\"\n   - \"when it comes to the UI, we should modify the plan so the LLM coding this gets the base layout, structure, and theme from the examples here: /Users/agurodriguez/Code/torre-ca/references/ui\"\n   - \"we dont need to add the pixel-precise references, just tell the llm to read those files\"\n   - \"[Request interrupted by user for tool use] Amazing! Go and implement it. Make sure to commit changes as you complete tasks (units of work); Use this standard for commit messages: Conventional Commits.\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - **Commit AGENTS.md and README.md** (Phase 9 — files are written to disk but not yet committed)\n   - **Phase 10: Dockerfiles + docker-compose** — `apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` at root\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Immediately before the summary request, AGENTS.md and README.md had just been written to disk:\n   - `AGENTS.md` — comprehensive engineering decisions doc at repo root covering: product constraints, visual design decisions (with specific color values), architecture, state management, testing, logging, deployment, API integration decisions, and the LLM instruction to keep it current\n   - `README.md` — engineer-facing doc with product overview, architecture ASCII diagram, tech stack table, getting started (with and without Docker), running tests, Dokploy deployment guide, environment variables table, and full project structure tree\n   \n   Neither file has been committed yet. Phase 10 (Dockerfiles + docker-compose) has not been started.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Commit AGENTS.md and README.md, then implement Phase 10: Dockerfiles for each app and docker-compose.yml. This directly continues the pending work from the approved plan.\n\n   From the plan: \"Phase 10 — Dockerfiles + docker-compose: `apps/api/Dockerfile` (production, for Dokploy) using turbo prune multi-stage build; `apps/web/Dockerfile` (same multi-stage pattern, scope=web, port 3000, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL as build arg); `docker-compose.yml` (root, local dev only — bind mounts + hot reload with named volumes for node_modules, corepack enable, healthcheck on /api/health, web depends_on api).\"\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3405,"cache_read_input_tokens":165519,"output_tokens":5673,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3405,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CYX8sHQ92fMNP9x5knshY","type":"assistant","uuid":"98fecec3-ef50-4b75-bb3b-88b9718aa353","timestamp":"2026-02-26T18:17:12.852Z"}
