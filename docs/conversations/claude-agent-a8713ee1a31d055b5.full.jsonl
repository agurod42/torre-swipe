The scoring process is driven by the job description, which acts as a query generator, and they compare the attributes of a person's genome to see how well the candidate is able to perform the requirements of the jobs.\n\n## Ranking and Skill Matching\n\nTorre's skill graph knows how all professional skills relate to each other and improves matching automatically. The final stage involves ranking the candidates in descending order of suitability, with the \"highest potential match\" candidates taking the top positions and gradually descending to \"lower potential matches.\"\n\n## Data Completeness\n\nThe genome completion ranker ranks candidates based on how much information is on their genomes. Candidates that have more complete genomes will be more accurately ranked because there is more information to validate their ranking.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4bec97c9-75c8-4b87-bcfa-c0c46f448a67","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:10:01.722Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"dbc173cf-4606-4af7-969e-36bc64bcfb16"}

What Torre.ai Is and Its Core Value Proposition\n\nTorre.ai is a global AI-powered professional networking and job-matching platform founded in 2019 by Colombian-American entrepreneur Alexander Torrenegra. The company's stated mission is to prevent human talent from going to waste by ensuring it is exposed to the right opportunities. Their ultimate goal is to build \"THE global job network\" and deliver real-time liquidity of jobs and candidates.\n\n**Core value proposition:** Torre positions itself as the first company to have fully automated recruiting end-to-end, describing itself as \"the Waymo for recruiting.\" Instead of relying on traditional resumes and manual recruiter work, Torre replaces that process with AI-driven matching using a rich structured profile called a \"professional genome.\" The result, they claim, is a hiring process that is 3x faster, 50% less expensive, and significantly more accurate than conventional methods.\n\nThe platform covers 180+ countries, has over 1 million users (reached in 2020), and is backed by early investors and executives from Apple, Amazon, Meta, and SpaceX. Total funding is approximately $15 million, including a $10 million seed round in April 2021.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Job Matching / Talent Matching Works\n\nTorre's matching engine is the centerpiece of the platform. Rather than keyword-matching a resume to a job description, it works in the following stages:\n\n1. **Job description as query generator** - The job listing acts as a structured query that generates matching criteria.\n2. **Genome comparison** - Every candidate's genome is compared against those criteria across 112+ factors.\n3. **Scoring** - Each candidate-job pair receives a match prediction score from 0 to 100%.\n4. **Ranked output** - Candidates are ranked in descending order from \"highest potential match\" to \"lower potential match.\"\n5. **Genome completeness as a modifier** - Candidates with more complete genomes are ranked more accurately because there is more data to validate their placement.\n\nTorre uses 9 distinct types of AI in combination to power this engine:\n- Decision-tree learning\n- Clustering\n- Large Language Models (GPT)\n- Machine-learning regressions\n- PageRank algorithms\n- Random forests\n- Gradient boosting regressors\n- Recommender engines\n- Word2Vec (NLP)\n\nThe system analyzed over 10 million professional profiles in 2024 and claims to reduce hiring time by up to 30%.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The \"Genome\" or Skill-Based Matching System\n\nThe professional genome is Torre's alternative to the traditional resume. It is a structured, multi-dimensional profile that captures thousands of data points across many dimensions:\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|---|---|\n| Work history | Roles, companies, dates, responsibilities |\n| Hard skills | Technical capabilities, tools, languages |\n| Soft skills | Communication, leadership, collaboration |\n| Preferences | Salary expectations, location, remote/in-person, languages |\n| Psychometrics | 40+ professional behavioral traits |\n| Behavioral models | HEXACO personality model, OCP (Organizational Culture Profile) instrument, Torre's own research |\n| Self-awareness | Candidate-reported strengths and blind spots |\n| Learning speed | Adaptability signals |\n| Social graph | Contact networks, referrals |\n| Validation signals | Reference checks, recommendations, certifications, portfolio |\n\nA key component is Torre's **skill graph** - a graph database that maps how all professional skills relate to each other. This allows the matching engine to reason about adjacent and transferable skills, not just exact keyword matches.\n\nPsychometric assessments are scientifically grounded in established models. Torre auto-analyzes 40+ professional behavioral traits, making this portion of the genome low-friction for candidates to complete.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Platform Features\n\n### For Candidates\n\n- **Professional Genome Profile** - A living, structured alternative to a resume, publicly shareable and indexed by search engines.\n- **Job Search** - Searchable at `torre.ai/search/jobs`, filtered by skills, location, salary, contract type, etc.\n- **Match Score Transparency** - Candidates can see how they rank against other applicants and receive specific feedback on why they rank the way they do and what they can improve.\n- **Job Network for Candidates** - A dedicated feed that surfaces matched opportunities automatically.\n- **AI Job Application (beta)** - Torre's AI can apply to any job on behalf of the candidate, even on external platforms.\n\n### For Companies / Recruiters\n\n- **Torre OS** - Described as \"the most advanced CRM and applicant tracking system,\" with 82+ unique functionalities covering the full recruiting lifecycle.\n- **Torre ATS** - An AI-native applicant tracking system. Automatically surfaces previous applicants for new job openings, manages pipeline stages, and sends automated candidate communications.\n- **Emma - AI Recruiter** - Torre's autonomous AI recruiter (see section 6). Covers 90%+ of traditional recruiter tasks.\n- **Job Distribution** - Publishes job openings to 15+ channels including LinkedIn, TikTok, Facebook, X, WhatsApp, job boards, and online communities.\n- **Candidate Databases** - Auto-builds and enriches candidate databases from across the web.\n- **Emma Reach** - A dedicated outbound sourcing product that identifies and attracts passive candidates.\n- **Torre Hunt** - Outsourced end-to-end recruitment where Emma handles the full hiring process.\n- **Subtorres** - Allows communities, companies, or individuals to spin up their own branded job board powered by Torre's AI infrastructure. Torre automatically imports relevant jobs from job boards, social media, and ATSs and drives traffic via the Torre Job Network, AI agents, search engines, and email marketing.\n\n---\n\n## 5. API Capabilities\n\nTorre offers a public API surface split into two tracks, plus an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for LLM agent integration.\n\n### API for Companies (`torre.ai/apiforcompanies`)\n- Search and filter candidates from Torre's database using dozens of criteria\n- Store job requirements, candidates, and applications and query them in multiple ways\n- Integrate with existing ATS, HRIS, or ERP systems\n- Access real-time compensation benchmarks (actual salary expectations from millions of candidates)\n- Adaptive interview guidance - the API tells you what question to ask the candidate next to reduce match/unmatch uncertainty\n- Auto-identify matching candidates from your own database for new openings\n- Use Torre's skill graph to power skill-adjacency reasoning in your own product\n- Build your own AI agent using your preferred LLM on top of Torre's data and infrastructure\n\n### API for Candidates (`torre.ai/apiforcandidates`)\n- Discover job opportunities programmatically\n- Delegate AI-driven job application to Torre's agent\n- Receive webhook pings when a new job matches the candidate's preferences\n- Status: **Private beta** as of the most recent available information\n\n### MCP Server\nTorre exposes an MCP server endpoint, indicating they are actively integrating with the emerging LLM agent ecosystem (compatible with Claude, GPT-based agents, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 6. How Candidates and Companies Interact on the Platform\n\nInteraction is largely mediated by Torre's AI layer rather than being direct person-to-person at the top of the funnel. The flow looks roughly like:\n\n1. **Job posting** - Company creates a job in Torre OS (or it is imported from external sources).\n2. **Emma activates** - Emma distributes the job across 15+ acquisition channels and proactively sources candidates.\n3. **Candidate engagement** - Candidates either discover the job organically or are contacted by Emma via Torre Messenger, email, WhatsApp, or SMS.\n4. **Application** - Candidates apply themselves, or Emma applies on their behalf.\n5. **Screening and ranking** - AI automatically screens, filters, and ranks all applicants using genome matching.\n6. **Transparency to candidates** - Candidates receive a score showing where they stand, why, and what they can do to improve. Torre often tells candidates who did not get an offer the specific reason.\n7. **Shortlisting** - Companies receive a ranked shortlist (typically 6-7 strong candidates surfaced from 200-500 applicants).\n8. **Reference checks** - Emma automates reference checking.\n9. **Re-engagement** - Candidates who were not selected are kept in the pipeline and notified of future relevant openings automatically.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Unique UX Patterns\n\n- **Genome as identity** - The profile is not a resume upload. It is a structured, first-party data form that progressively prompts users for richer information over time. Completeness is gamified by the genome completion ranker, which rewards fuller profiles with better match placement.\n- **Transparent scoring** - Unlike most ATS platforms that hide ranking logic from candidates, Torre exposes the match score, the contributing factors, and improvement suggestions. This is a deliberate UX differentiator.\n- **Bidirectional matching** - The fit score is mutual: it predicts whether a candidate fits the role and team, and whether the role and team fit the candidate. This is surfaced to both sides.\n- **Compensation transparency** - Salary expectations are part of the genome and are surfaced to companies as benchmark data, reducing late-stage mismatches.\n- **AI as the primary recruiter UX** - Emma interacts with candidates in natural language via multiple channels (chat, email, WhatsApp, SMS), handling screening conversations that traditionally required a human recruiter.\n- **Subtorres embedded job boards** - A white-label / embedded job board product for communities and companies, powered by the same matching infrastructure.\n- **Skill graph navigation** - The platform allows talent search by skill with awareness of related/adjacent skills, so a search for \"React\" might surface candidates with strong Vue.js or Angular skills as related matches.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Torre.ai - The new global job network](https://torre.ai/)\n- [Torre's Job-Matching Model](https://torre.ai/jobmatchingmodel)\n- [Torre's Job-Matching Model | Genome completion](https://torre.ai/jobmatchingmodel/genomecompletion)\n- [Professional genomes: Tomorrow's résumé today](https://torre.ai/en/genome)\n- [Torre API](https://torre.ai/api)\n- [Torre API for companies](https://torre.ai/apiforcompanies)\n- [Torre API for candidates](https://torre.ai/apiforcandidates)\n- [Emma of Torre.ai](https://torre.ai/emma)\n- [Emma Reach](https://torre.ai/reach)\n- [Torre Hunt](https://torre.ai/hunt)\n- [Torre OS](https://torre.ai/os)\n- [Torre ATS](https://torre.ai/ats)\n- [Torre Job Network](https://torre.ai/jobnetwork)\n- [Torre Job Marketplace](https://torre.ai/jobmarketplace)\n- [Subtorres](https://torre.ai/subtorres)\n- [Torre Tech](https://torre.ai/tech)\n- [Torre for companies](https://torre.ai/forcompanies)\n- [Torre for candidates](https://torre.ai/forcandidates)\n- [How Does Torre Company Work? - CanvasBusinessModel.com](https://canvasbusinessmodel.com/blogs/how-it-works/torre-how-it-works)\n- [Torre.ai - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre.co)\n- [Torre.ai - Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/torre)\n- [Torre.ai: AI-Powered Recruitment Automation - FindMoreAI](https://findmoreai.com/en/ai-tools/torre-ai)\n- [Unpacking Torre AI - Oreate AI Blog](https://www.oreateai.com/blog/unpacking-torre-ai-a-comprehensive-review-of-its-features-and-user-experience/111c676320fb9d2dbbcb4d03e68f3338)\n- [GitHub - behagoras/torre-api](https://github.com/behagoras/torre-api)"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1370,"cache_read_input_tokens":19267,"output_tokens":2863,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1370,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CYX43oKAGRhXdZuXmzv1h","type":"assistant","uuid":"79a4e98c-55b1-40b7-baba-6fff75f8f29e","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:13:06.285Z"}
