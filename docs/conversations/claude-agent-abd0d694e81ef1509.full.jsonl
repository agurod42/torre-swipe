Here are the key findings:\n\n## Tinder Swipe Interaction Overview\n\nThe swiping motion has become a central element of Tinder's UI design and has emerged as one of the most popular mobile UI patterns. Tinder actually pioneered an incredibly interesting and unique gesture-based interaction pattern that set the standard for many mobiles apps in the software industry today.\n\n## Core Mechanics\n\n**Gesture Detection:**\nEach card uses a UIPanGestureRecognizer internally to listen for Pan gestures such as a user 'grabbing' a card with their finger and moving it around the screen, then flicking it or lifting their finger. The Began, Changed, Ended states specify if the user has started a pan, a pan is in progress or a pan has finished.\n\n**Swipe Actions:**\nUsers can swipe right to like a photo or swipe left to dislike it.\n\n## Animation Patterns\n\nEach card reacts to user gestures, and we remove the top card from the deck when a swipe exceeds a certain threshold. The DragGesture handles all the swipe detection, and once a card is swiped, we update the stack.\n\nThe card itself animates, pushing off to the right or left and down using translate to make it move. It's pretty straightforward, and you could tweak the animations to make the card sweep to the left or right or snap back, depending on how responsive your want your interface to behave.\n\n**Visual Feedback:**\nFeatures include a dynamic shadow that changes color depending on the swipe direction.\n\nThe search results primarily contain implementation guides and tutorials rather than 2024-specific design updates to the Tinder UI pattern itself.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a0d15cb1-981b-4db1-bc80-53b39d999ca9","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:13:59.893Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4adbcd2e-18c2-4351-b91e-95a46d785617"}

The UX is straightforward: Job seekers swipe to apply to jobs, or left to pass on positions, while employers respond and swipe right to reciprocate interest, or left to eliminate the candidate.\n\nKey features include:\n- Switch uses a double opt-in technique, meaning job seekers and employers must both say yes before moving forward, using swiping technology and intelligent matching algorithms\n- Switch's matching algorithm analyzes the job seeker's location, experience, and skills to bring them jobs they may be interested in\n- Switch's anonymous platform allows you to be \"on the market\" without the worry of current employers or clients finding out\n\n## Jobr App\n\nJobr allowed candidates to connect their LinkedIn account and create a profile, then swipe through jobs in a similar fashion to Switch. A key differentiator from Switch was that it would tell you which skills matched your CV and identify people you knew there, filtering data from phone contacts.\n\n## App Status & Challenges\n\nUnfortunately, both apps faced difficulties. Switch was the largest with over $2 million in seed funding in 2015 and continued to grow until July 2021, when growth suddenly stopped. Jobr relied heavily on LinkedIn, and unfortunately for the app, LinkedIn eventually locked down its API, forcing the app to resort to Facebook logins.\n\n## Current Swipe-Based Job Apps\n\nOther current alternatives include JobSwipe, where users swipe right to shortlist and left to delete jobs, and swipejobs, which puts users in control to choose jobs with a swipe, using AI-powered matching.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e17e1c2b-d1f1-44dc-8a19-0194f9625ff7","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:14:01.540Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b291939d-3036-48c7-8e7d-6a5d63596f95"}

This is one of the most popular options for web implementations. Swipe callbacks return a direction string denoting which way the swipe was in: 'left', 'right', 'up' or 'down'. The 'position' mode evaluates direction based on the position the card has on the screen like in the app tinder.\n\n### **react-swipy**\nA simple Tinder-like swipeable React component that provides more control over swipe interactions compared to deck-based alternatives.\n\n## Implementation Features\n\nThe typical workflow includes:\n- Callbacks that execute when a swipe has been completed, called with a string denoting the swipe direction: 'left', 'right', 'up' or 'down'.\n- The ability to programmatically trigger a swipe of the card in valid directions by calling the swipe function on a TinderCard instance reference.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nIt's essential to sync the state of your Tinder Cards with your React application's state management, whether using Context, Redux, or another state management library, ensuring swipe states are accurately reflected across the app.\n\n## Framer Motion Integration\n\nWhile the search results don't provide specific 2024 examples of framer-motion implementation with react-tinder-card, Framer Motion is commonly used as a complementary animation library for enhancing card animations beyond the basic swipe mechanics.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3588c3c3-43c2-44bb-a49f-3538d0177e13","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:14:22.908Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0300807d-f735-4370-a441-fde047d2d798"}

This prevents information overload while keeping cards digestible.\n\n**Card Stack Depth**\n\nCustomizing how many cards are visible in the stack at one time and how they are scaled enhances UX by letting designers create more engaging and visually appealing card stacks where depth and hierarchy can be easily perceived. Values ranging from 0.9 to 0.99 for scaling can achieve desired visual effects.\n\n**Gamification & Discrete Decisions**\n\nCards create repetitive, deliberate, discrete decision moments over and over, which transforms browsing into an engaging experience compared to endless scrolling.\n\n## Frustrating Design Patterns\n\n**Multiple Gestures & Content Conflicts**\n\nMultiple gestures including image carousels can create confusion and usability issues, particularly for users with cognitive and dexterity disabilities. Cards should not contain swipeable content such as image carousels or pagination, and swipe gestures should not cause portions of cards to detach upon swipe.\n\n**Consistency Issues**\n\nA card should only have one swipe action assigned to it, and gestures should be implemented consistently within a card collection.\n\n**Carousel Problems**\n\nCarousels can showcase featured content but can also cause distraction, confusion, or frustration if not designed well.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0f813bc1-141e-48d1-ac63-d528fbf4b02d","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:14:39.533Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"7d64eba7-b6c9-40d7-a83d-a94735db90f2"}

Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Tinder Card Stack Design Pattern\n\nTinder pioneered an incredibly interesting and unique gesture-based interaction pattern that set the standard for many mobile apps in the software industry today. This has led to investors, designers and engineers referring to business ideas as \"the Tinder for X\" — alluding to the way that it adopts Tinder's swipe-able card system.\n\n## Key Animation and Interaction Mechanics\n\nThe core interaction design involves several critical elements:\n\n1. **Swipe Mechanics**: Tinder emphasizes a 'Swipe Left' or 'Swipe Right' to accept/reject paradigm that makes this interface feel more controlled.\n\n2. **Card Movement and Rotation**: When users drag their finger and the card around the screen, a transformation is applied so the card follows their finger, with a slight rotation on the view to give more of a 'flickable' arch to the card.\n\n3. **Stack Logic**: Tinder cards are usually used in a \"stack\" of cards, focusing mainly on the gestures and animation aspect of this functionality.\n\n4. **Visual Feedback**: Cards have cool features like a dynamic shadow that changes color depending on the swipe direction.\n\n## UX Effectiveness\n\nThe Tinder card format provides an effective user experience for prominently displaying relevant information and having the user commit to making an instantaneous decision on what has been presented.\n\nThe search results primarily focus on implementation guides and technical documentation rather than specific information about Tinder's \"super like\" mechanic or 2024 design updates. For more current information about those specific features, you may need to search for more recent Tinder design documentation.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a401959a-d108-478a-8314-93b56bb72083","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:14:41.164Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cba3fc38-3740-4d4b-b030-930a62fcca0f"}

This swipe interaction pattern has been adopted by various job discovery platforms to make the process more intuitive.\n\n## LinkedIn's AI-Powered Career Discovery\n\nMore recently, LinkedIn has shifted toward AI-powered career discovery tools that enable members to describe their dream role in plain language, with LinkedIn's AI interpreting and matching those aspirations to real job opportunities. The feature is designed to make job searching feel more like a conversation with a career advisor, where someone can say things like \"I want to use marketing skills to cure cancer\" or \"Find me entry-level jobs in the gaming industry,\" and the system interprets the intent and delivers relevant options.\n\n## Product UX Evolution\n\nLinkedIn displays member compatibility level with job posts based on profile info, making it easier to find the most relevant opportunities. This conversational job discovery is powered by LinkedIn's Economic Graph and leverages large language models across the full search stack.\n\nThe search results show a transition from traditional swipe-based interactions to more sophisticated AI-driven conversational discovery tools that better serve professional users in finding roles aligned with their career goals.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ed79c4c9-09d8-4d7f-b431-4fe2e4fa95a3","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:14:53.792Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ec6b6279-d5b8-400d-ba71-d2202b9b24eb"}

When someone Super Likes another user, that person's profile appears on top of their card stack with a bright blue border and star.\n\n## Visual Design & Animation\n\nThe distinctive blue star icon associated with a Super Like is designed to capture attention, making it a focal point that can alter initial perceptions. The upswipe gesture itself is part of Tinder's broader design strategy—the app is centered around two smartphone gestures: swipe left to pass or swipe right to show interest.\n\n## Engagement Impact\n\nThe feature has proven highly effective. Tinder claimed that \"Super Liking\" makes it three times more likely you'll match and that your conversations with matches will last 70 percent longer. Additionally, profiles with Super Likes see a 70% increase in engagement compared to standard Likes.\n\n## Psychology & Design\n\nThe Super Like taps into multiple psychological principles:\n\n- **Validation & Attention**: Receiving a Super Like can invoke a sense of validation and curiosity in the recipient, prompting them to engage more readily with the sender.\n\n- **Gamification & Engagement**: Tinder leverages the power of gamification, turning the search for potential matches into an engaging game through the simplicity of swiping right or left, which keeps users hooked as they want to see who they match with next.\n\n- **Psychological Mechanisms**: Swiping apps employ simplified decision mechanics and reward-based interface cues that resemble slot-machine dynamics, activating dopaminergic anticipation loops that can heighten compulsive use.\n\n- **Intentionality Signaling**: The perceived intention behind a Super Like signifies a purposeful action rather than casual interest, thus facilitating deeper connections and initiating conversations that may not occur otherwise.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"eb011306-9fa0-4bf2-a95f-e40d7c6bed14","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:14:54.301Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4d29a3f6-d06b-42d1-94b6-6ce5975cdf05"}

However, dopamine is not just a \"pleasure molecule\"; it is a craving molecule.\n\nThe key to engagement lies in unpredictability. Skinner discovered that the most effective way to reinforce behavior was not through consistent rewards, but through Variable Ratio Schedules of Reinforcement. When you get a reward sometimes when you press a button, but you never know when (Result: Obsessive behavior).\n\n## Swipe Mechanics and Slot Machine Parallels\n\nApps make the action as simple as possible—a double tap, a swipe, or an infinite scroll. The swipe gesture itself is designed to trigger engagement. Each swipe delivers a tiny dopamine spike, priming you for the possibility of a payoff. You don't keep scrolling because you found something, you keep scrolling because you might find something next.\n\nThese rewards, when spaced unpredictably (variable rewards), create an especially strong psychological grip. That unpredictability mimics slot machines, making the behavior even more compulsive.\n\n## Gamification in Mobile Design\n\nApps offer Rewards of the Tribe: Social validation (likes, comments); Rewards of the Hunt: Material resources or information (news, content); and Rewards of the Self: Mastery and competency (leveling up, completing a task).\n\nPoints and badges give small, frequent boosts of dopamine, which makes us want to come back. Small rewards keep the brain engaged and looking for the next achievement.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nTinder is entirely built around the pursuit of variable rewards. Behind every swipe is another potential match. Is it the $0 reward on which you swipe left, the $10 reward with whom you go on a couple of dates, or the $1,000 jackpot who becomes your life partner of 50+ years? All you have to do is keep on swiping to find out.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nWhile dopamine-driven design can enhance user engagement, it's a double-edged sword. Overuse of these techniques can lead to compulsive behavior, digital burnout, or even harm.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"10117f3b-f5b8-420a-befe-ef806a85cab8","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:15:08.485Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"092db2f6-8ec9-4960-83d6-43a4fd08444f"}

Users upload their resume, swipe right on jobs they want and left on those they don't, and when a user swipes right, an AI Agent applies on their behalf.\n\n**Switch** - The app allows users to quickly browse job postings by swiping right to like or left to pass, while hiring managers do the same thing browsing through anonymized candidate profiles. When there's a match, you and the recruiter are placed in direct contact.\n\n**swipejobs** - The app lets users choose jobs fitting their schedule and preferences with a swipe, and uses AI-powered matching to connect users directly with businesses in their area.\n\n**JobSwipe** - Features intelligent search technology that refines job matches based on your swipes.\n\n**Other Platforms** - In similar matching platforms, a swipe right is matched when both employer and candidate swipe right, and once matched, both entities can chat in messages.\n\nThese platforms implement the double opt-in/mutual matching concept you mentioned, where both the job seeker and employer need to express interest before connecting.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7b5c3813-92ec-4cf5-b7b0-e1c9f9dd6248","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:15:18.279Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d942bed0-1e25-4212-9b50-44eddd24051b"}

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Swipe Gesture Best Practices\n\nA swipe gesture is a finger movement across a screen to perform specific actions, vertically or horizontally. Swipe-to-delete is a horizontal swipe action often used to delete an item, while swipe-to-reveal reveals hidden options or contextual actions.\n\n## Threshold and Snap Back\n\nA 200 millisecond threshold was found to be about right for swipe interactions, and an unusually ponderous click is recoverable with a second attempt.\n\n## Accessibility Concerns\n\nSwipe gestures can present significant challenges for users with disabilities, particularly those with motor impairments such as reduced hand dexterity or tremors, who may struggle to perform precise gestures. Multiple gestures can create confusion and usability/accessibility issues, particularly for users with cognitive and dexterity disabilities.\n\n## Accessible Alternatives\n\nInclude clearly visible icons or buttons next to items for actions like \"Delete\" or \"Archive,\" providing users with an intuitive, easily accessible option. Ensure swipe actions are accessible through alternative input methods such as buttons or menus, and don't rely solely on swipe gestures as they may be challenging for users with mobility or dexterity limitations.\n\n## Button Labels and Overlay Design\n\nButton labels should start with a verb to describe a specific action, with one word being ideal. Icon-only buttons may not be understandable by users; use standard icons with relevant labels so users with cognitive disabilities can understand the button's function.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f84d5470-2c0f-4a06-8d22-47aadb2f674d","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:15:20.829Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"c46faadf-e419-449f-8b7d-6925637fee65"}

Users report difficulty contacting support and receiving error messages when attempting to report bugs.\n\n**Functionality Problems:**\nThe JobSwipe app's swiping right feature only allows users to shortlist jobs rather than directly apply, which undermines a core value proposition. Some users repeatedly receive messages asking them to complete application steps but are unable to proceed after entering information multiple times.\n\n**Professional Context Issues:**\nJob swipe apps encounter challenges related to job listing quality and client interactions, with freelancers facing unprofessional clients and unrealistic expectations. Users experience fierce competition as large numbers of freelancers vie for the same opportunities, with certain markets experiencing oversaturation.\n\n**UX Criticism:**\nThe swiping mechanism itself, borrowed from dating apps, doesn't naturally fit the professional job search context. Despite technological innovation, applying for jobs remains one of the few consumer categories that hasn't significantly improved, with the core hiring model barely changed since newspaper classifieds.\n\nThe search results show these apps face fundamental usability and business model challenges when adapting casual app interaction patterns to professional hiring contexts.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"85fd930b-b1a5-48cb-a33e-f5c8fbf70a07","timestamp":"2026-02-26T17:15:32.300Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"19a8f47d-f1d7-44ba-b2e3-b5231c9e595d"}

Core Mechanics of the Swipe Experience\n\n### Gesture Detection\nThe foundation of every swipe card interface is a pan/drag gesture recognizer. On mobile, this is a `UIPanGestureRecognizer` (iOS) or an equivalent touch event listener. The gesture has three lifecycle states: **Began** (user touches the card), **Changed** (card follows the finger), and **Ended** (card is released and a decision is made).\n\nThe card follows the user's finger via a CSS `transform: translate(x, y)` or equivalent, with a **rotational component** added to simulate the physics of flicking a physical card:\n\n```\nrotation = x_offset * rotation_factor\ntransform = rotate(rotation_deg) translate(x, y)\n```\n\n### Swipe Threshold\nA threshold is defined - typically ~100-150px of travel or a minimum velocity - to determine whether a swipe is intentional. If the card doesn't cross the threshold, it **snaps back** to center via a spring animation. If it does, it **flies off screen** in the swipe direction.\n\n### Direction Support\nModern implementations support four directions:\n- **Right** = accept / like\n- **Left** = reject / pass\n- **Up** = super like / strong interest\n- **Down** = rarely used (sometimes \"undo\" or \"not now\")\n\n### Visual Feedback Overlays\nAs the card moves, directional **stamp overlays** appear, fading in proportionally to displacement:\n- Green \"LIKE\" label (right drag)\n- Red \"NOPE\" label (left drag)\n- Blue/gold \"SUPER\" label (upward drag)\n\nThe card's drop shadow changes color correspondingly to reinforce the feedback.\n\n### Card Stack Appearance\nCards beneath the top card are visible but slightly scaled and offset, creating a **depth illusion**. Typically:\n- Card 1 (top): `scale(1.0)`, full opacity\n- Card 2: `scale(0.97)`, slightly pushed down (~8-12px)\n- Card 3: `scale(0.94)`, further offset\n- 3 cards max are usually shown; beyond that is wasted computation\n\nAs the top card is dismissed, the cards beneath animate upward and scale up to take their new positions. This transition is the most satisfying part of the UX.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Job-Matching Apps with Swipe Mechanics: What Worked and What Didn't\n\n### Switch (2015-2021)\n**Model:** Both job seekers and employers swipe independently. A \"match\" is only created when both swipe right on each other - the **double opt-in** model.\n\n**What worked:**\n- Anonymous profiles for candidates reduced fear of being discovered by current employers\n- Double opt-in felt fairer and more respectful than cold applications\n- Raised $2M in seed funding; proven there was demand\n\n**What didn't:**\n- Died in July 2021. The marketplace chicken-and-egg problem: without enough employers, candidates had nothing to swipe; without candidates, employers didn't engage\n- Competing with LinkedIn's entrenched network effects was impossible\n\nSources: [Switch - Tinder for Jobs (JobTrain)](https://hub.jobtrain.co.uk/blog/switch-and-jobr-tinder-for-jobs), [Switch TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/22/switch-with-2-million-in-seed-funding-is-tinder-for-jobs/)\n\n### Jobr\n**Model:** Linked to LinkedIn profiles; job seekers swiped through company job postings. Showed which skills matched and which contacts worked at the company.\n\n**What worked:**\n- Surfacing mutual connections and skill-match percentage gave richer context than a flat swipe\n- LinkedIn integration reduced onboarding friction\n\n**What didn't:**\n- LinkedIn locked down its API, killing the app's core data source\n- Demonstrates the fatal risk of building on top of a platform that can revoke access\n\nSource: [Switch and Jobr (JobTrain)](https://hub.jobtrain.co.uk/blog/switch-and-jobr-tinder-for-jobs)\n\n### swipejobs (active)\n**Model:** AI-powered matching for shift/hourly workers. Workers swipe jobs; employers get pre-filtered qualified candidates.\n\n**What works:**\n- Targets the hourly/gig sector where decisions are genuinely simpler (location, pay, schedule) - a great fit for the swipe paradigm because there are fewer variables to weigh\n- Workers feel in control of their schedule\n\nSource: [swipejobs App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swipejobs/id1550227423)\n\n### Sorce (2024)\n**Model:** Resume-based swiping with AI that applies on behalf of the user. 7.5M+ swipes since August 2024.\n\n**What works:**\n- Removing the apply-friction entirely (AI applies for you on a right swipe) dramatically lowers the effort barrier\n- Treats the swipe as a signal for the AI, not a formal application\n\nSource: [Sorce Jobs](https://www.sorce.jobs/)\n\n### Shapr (professional networking)\n**Model:** Daily batch of 15-20 professionals matched by interests and goals. Swipe to connect.\n\n**What worked:**\n- Limited daily batch prevents decision fatigue (you can't binge-swipe like Tinder)\n- Limiting cards creates scarcity that makes each profile feel more meaningful\n- Mutual interest required before messaging eliminates cold outreach awkwardness\n\n**What didn't:**\n- Matching quality is harder in professional networking (intent is diffuse - mentorship? collaboration? sales?) versus job search (intent is clear)\n\nSource: [Networking Apps (Medium)](https://medium.com/swlh/networking-apps-that-can-change-the-way-you-work-aff4bfd08c86), [Inc - Brutal Truth About Networking Apps](https://www.inc.com/david-olk/the-brutal-truth-about-networking-apps-everyone-needs-to-hear.html)\n\n### Bumble Bizz\n**Model:** Professional mode within Bumble dating app. Women make the first move.\n\n**What worked:**\n- Borrowed network from existing Bumble users; no cold start\n- Low harassment rates due to the \"women first\" rule\n\n**What didn't:**\n- The dating app origin created an uncomfortable cultural association (\"feels like a hookup app\")\n- No industry/interest filtering meant low-signal matches\n- Event-dependent networking rather than on-demand\n\nSource: [Bumble Bizz Introduction](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/bumble-bizz-career-professional-networking), [LinkedIn - Networking for Introverts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-shapr-bumble-networking-tactics-introverts-chad-davies)\n\n### LinkedIn's Own Swipe Experiment\nIn 2016 LinkedIn tested a Tinder-like swipe interface for college students to discover jobs. It was eventually retired in favor of conversational AI-powered job search (\"describe your dream role in plain language\"). The lesson: for white-collar professionals, nuanced search beats binary swipe decisions.\n\nSource: [GeekWire - LinkedIn Swipe](https://www.geekwire.com/2016/swipe-right-apply-linkedin-courts-college-students-tinder-like-job-hunting-app/)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Best UX Patterns for Card-Based Swiping\n\n### What Makes Them Engaging\n- **Discrete, micro-decisions**: Each card forces a single yes/no decision. This is more satisfying than scrolling a list because the decision feels complete and consequential.\n- **Variable reward psychology**: You don't know what the next card holds. This mirrors a slot machine: the anticipation of a potentially great match (or job) releases dopamine on each reveal. Tinder is explicitly designed around this loop.\n- **Physical metaphor**: Swiping maps to a natural action (sorting a deck of cards). The gesture is immediately intuitive without instruction.\n- **Speed and flow**: A well-tuned stack lets users burn through cards in a flow state. Friction breaks this.\n- **Match moment**: The \"It's a match!\" animation (confetti, expanding card, celebration) creates a genuine emotional reward that reinforces continued use.\n\nSource: [Gamification Psychology (Pop Neuro)](https://www.popneuro.com/neuromarketing-blog/psychology-dating-apps-gamification-random-rewards-consumer-behavior-lessons), [Designing for Dopamine (UX Magazine)](https://uxmag.com/articles/designing-for-dopamine)\n\n### What Makes Them Frustrating\n- **Information deficit on cards**: If the card lacks enough context to make a decision, users feel blind. Job cards must show: role title, company name, location, salary range, and 1-2 culture signals at minimum.\n- **Too much information on cards**: Walls of text kill the flow. Cards should have max 3-4 data points and an image/logo. The full detail can be revealed on tap/expand.\n- **Conflicting gestures**: Embedding an image carousel inside a swipeable card creates a gesture conflict (horizontal swipe = next image vs. swipe left = reject). Avoid nested scrollable/swipeable content inside cards.\n- **No undo**: Users make accidental swipes. If there is no \"rewind\" mechanic, the frustration can break sessions.\n- **Thin queues**: If the stack runs out of cards, the experience dead-ends. This is a content/matching problem but a UX failure.\n- **Artificial limits without clear value exchange**: Limiting swipes (Tinder's 100/12hr free limit) requires clear communication of what the limit is and what's gained by upgrading.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Technical Approaches: Libraries and Frameworks\n\n### Web (React)\n\n**`react-tinder-card`** (most popular, ~7k weekly downloads)\n- npm: [`react-tinder-card`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tinder-card)\n- GitHub: [3DJakob/react-tinder-card](https://github.com/3DJakob/react-tinder-card)\n- Works for both web and React Native with the same API\n- Exposes `onSwipe`, `onCardLeftScreen`, `swipe()` ref method\n- Supports left/right/up/down directions\n- Simple to integrate but limited animation customization\n\n```jsx\nimport TinderCard from 'react-tinder-card'\n\n<TinderCard onSwipe={(dir) => console.log('swiped ' + dir)} preventSwipe={['up', 'down']}>\n  <div className=\"card\">Job Card Content</div>\n</TinderCard>\n```\n\n**`@use-gesture/react` + `@react-spring/web`** (most flexible/performant)\n- The combination used by most production-quality implementations\n- `@use-gesture` handles drag/pointer events with velocity, distance, direction\n- `react-spring` provides physics-based spring animations (not easing curves - actual spring physics)\n- 100% GPU-accelerated via `transform` - no layout thrashing\n- The canonical React Spring example \"Cards Stack\" demonstrates this exact pattern\n\n```jsx\nimport { useSprings, animated } from '@react-spring/web'\nimport { useDrag } from '@use-gesture/react'\n\n// Springs drive card position; drag gesture updates spring targets\nconst [props, api] = useSprings(cards.length, i => ({ x: 0, rot: 0, scale: 1 }))\nconst bind = useDrag(({ args: [index], active, movement: [mx], velocity: [vx] }) => {\n  const trigger = vx > 0.2  // velocity threshold\n  if (!active && trigger) gone.add(index)\n  api.start(i => i === index ? { x: active ? mx : gone.has(i) ? (200 + window.innerWidth) * (mx > 0 ? 1 : -1) : 0 } : {})\n})\n```\n\nSources: [@use-gesture docs](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/), [React Spring examples](https://www.react-spring.dev/examples), [Tinder Card with react-spring (Medium)](https://medium.com/swlh/tinder-card-swipe-feature-using-react-spring-and-react-use-gesture-7236d7abf2db)\n\n**`framer-motion`** (easiest for prototyping)\n- `dragConstraints`, `drag`, `onDragEnd` props handle the gesture\n- `AnimatePresence` handles exit animations\n- Good for prototypes; less control over physics than react-spring\n- Higher bundle weight\n\nSource: [Tinder-like card game with Framer Motion (DEV.to)](https://dev.to/lansolo99/a-tinder-like-card-game-with-framer-motion-35i5)\n\n**`swing`** (vanilla JS, framework-agnostic)\n- GitHub: [gajus/swing](https://github.com/gajus/swing)\n- Older but dependency-free; good for non-React contexts\n\n### React Native\n\n- **`rn-tinder-card`** / **`rn-swiper-list`** - Lightning-fast, Reanimated 2 based\n- **`react-native-deck-swiper`** - Feature-rich, widely used\n- **`react-native-gesture-handler`** + **`react-native-reanimated`** - The low-level primitives for custom implementations\n\n---\n\n## 5. Engaging vs. Frustrating: The Critical Factors\n\n| Factor | Engaging | Frustrating |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| Card reveal speed | Instant, 60fps | Laggy, jank on old devices |\n| Snap-back animation | Spring physics feel | Linear ease feels robotic |\n| Decision threshold | Forgiving (not too sensitive) | Hair-trigger (accidental swipes) |\n| Queue depth | Always 3+ cards visible | Stack runs empty |\n| Undo | Available (at least once) | None - mistakes are final |\n| Match feedback | Celebratory animation + sound | Minimal or no acknowledgment |\n| Info density | Name + key signal only | Resume dump on small card |\n| Daily limits | Clear limit with clear benefit | Surprise gate mid-session |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Design Patterns: Cards, Stacks, Animations, and Super-Like\n\n### Card Stack Visual Design\n- Show 2-3 cards behind the active card, each scaled ~3% smaller and offset 8-10px downward\n- The peeking effect creates perceived depth without cluttering the UI\n- When top card dismisses, animate remaining cards up with a spring (not a tween) so the motion feels alive\n\n### Overlay Labels\n- Overlay labels (\"LIKE\", \"NOPE\") should:\n  - Appear at corner opposite the drag direction (like a rubber stamp tilted from the corner)\n  - Use bold, rotated text (typically 25-30deg)\n  - Fade in proportionally to horizontal displacement (opacity = distance / threshold)\n  - Color-coded: green for right, red for left, blue/gold for super like\n\n### Super Like Mechanic\n- Triggered by **upward swipe** or a dedicated star button\n- The recipient sees a **blue star banner** at the top of the swiper's profile card\n- Tinder reports Super Likes generate **3x the match rate** and **70% longer conversations**\n- In job context: this maps naturally to a \"Top Applicant\" or \"Highly Interested\" signal\n- The power of Super Like comes from **scarcity** - free users get 1/day, which makes each feel meaningful\n- Psychology: signals intentionality beyond a casual swipe, which provokes curiosity and validation in the recipient\n\nSource: [Psychology Today - Tinder Super Like](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/real-happiness-in-a-digital-world/202301/the-tinder-super-like-hints-at-illusions-of-control), [What Does a Super Like Do on Tinder?](https://anhome.tech/blog/tech-tips/what-does-a-super-like-do-on-tinder/)\n\n### Match Animation\n- The match moment must be emotionally rewarding: a full-screen takeover with the two profile images, confetti or particle effect, sound cue, and a strong CTA (\"Send a message\")\n- This is the reward at the end of the variable reward loop - it must feel disproportionately satisfying relative to the effort of swiping\n- In job matching: the equivalent is \"Company X is interested in you\" with the employer's logo and a message prompt\n\n### Button Controls (for accessibility and discoverability)\n- Always provide **X / Heart / Star buttons** below the card as alternatives to gestures\n- Gestures alone are inaccessible to users with motor impairments\n- Buttons should animate the card programmatically using the same animation path as a gesture swipe (not a fade/opacity change)\n\n### Information Architecture on Cards\nFor job cards specifically, the research from failed apps points to this optimal hierarchy:\n1. **Hero**: Company logo + cover image or brand color\n2. **Above the fold**: Job title, company name, location, salary range\n3. **At-a-glance signals**: 2-3 tags (e.g., \"Remote\", \"Series B\", \"Python\")\n4. **On expand/tap**: Full description, requirements, team info, culture\n\nNever show a full job description on the card face - this kills swipe velocity and creates cognitive overload.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways for Professional/Job Context\n\n1. **Swipe works best for simple decisions.** The mechanic shines for hourly/gig workers (swipejobs) where the variables are few. For knowledge workers, the decision is rarely binary, which is why LinkedIn moved toward conversational AI search instead.\n\n2. **Double opt-in is essential for professional dignity.** Both sides must express interest before connection. One-sided applications feel like cold spam; the mutual match changes the emotional context entirely.\n\n3. **Scarcity beats abundance.** Shapr's limited daily batch outperforms unlimited swiping in professional context because it forces reflection. Tinder Gold's success proves users will pay to remove limits - but the limits must exist first.\n\n4. **The match moment must be designed.** Most job swipe apps treat the match as a notification. The apps that retain users treat it as a celebration. This single screen is disproportionately important.\n\n5. **Don't rebuild LinkedIn.** Apps that tried to replicate full professional profiles in card format failed.
